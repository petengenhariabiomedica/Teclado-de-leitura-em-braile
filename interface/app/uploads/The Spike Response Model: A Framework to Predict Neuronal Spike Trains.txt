WE PROPOSE A SIMPLE METHOD TO MAP A GENERIC THRESHOLD MODEL, NAMELY THE SPIKE RESPONSE MODEL, TO ARTIFICIAL DATA OF NEURONAL ACTIVITY USING A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF A PRIORI INFORMATION. HERE, DATA ARE GENERATED BY A DETAILED MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF NEURONAL ACTIVITY. THE MODEL NEURON IS DRIVEN WITH IN-VIVO -LIKE CURRENT INJECTED, AND WE TEST TO WHICH EXTENT IT IS POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE SPIKE TRAIN OF THE DETAILED NEURON MODEL FROM THAT OF THE SPIKE RESPONSE MODEL. IN PARTICULAR, WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF SPIKES CORRECTLY PREDICTED WITHIN A BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT TIME WINDOW. WE FIND THAT THE SPIKE RESPONSE MODEL ACHIEVES PREDICTION OF UP TO 80 OF THE SPIKES WITH CORRECT TIMING ( 2MS). OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF ACTIVITY, SUCH AS MEAN RATE AND COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION OF SPIKE TRAINS, ARE PREDICTED IN THE CORRECT RANGE AS WELL. 1 INTRODUCTION THE SUCCESSFUL MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION OF ACTION POTENTIALS BY HODGKIN AND HUXLEY HAS LED TO A WHOLE SERIES OF PAPERS THAT TRY TO DESCRIBE IN DETAIL THE DYNAMICS OF VARIOUS IONIC CURRENTS. HOWEVER, PRECISE DESCRIPTION OF NEURONAL AC- TIVITY INVOLVES AN EXTENSIVE NUMBER OF VARIABLES, WHICH OFTEN PREVENTS A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING DYNAMICS. HENCE, A SIMPLIFIED DESCRIPTION IS DE- SIRABLE AND HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS WORKS. THE MOST POPULAR SIMPLIFIED MODELS INCLUDE THE INTEGRATE-AND-FIRE (IF) MODEL, THE FITZHUGH-NAGUMO MODEL AND THE MORRIS-LECAR MODEL (FOR A REVIEW, SEE 1). IN THIS PAPER, WE MAKE USE OF THE SPIKE RESPONSE MODEL (SRM), A GENERIC THRESHOLD MODEL OF THE IF TYPE. SIMILAR TO EARLIER WORK 2, WE MAP THE SRM TO A DETAILED MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF NEURONAL ACTIVITY. BUT, IN CONTRAST OF WHAT HAS BEEN DONE IN 2, WE GO BEYOND THE CLASSIC HODGKIN-HUXLEY NEURON MODEL OF THE SQUID AXON AND USE INSTEAD A MODEL OF A CORTICAL INTERNEURON. MOREOVER, WE USE A DIFFERENT MAPPING TECHNIQUE THAT COULD ALSO BE APPLIED TO REAL NEURONS. WE SHOW THAT SUCH A SIMPLE TECHNIQUE ALLOWS RELIABLE PREDICTION OF THE SPIKE TRAIN OF O. KAYNAK ET AL.
